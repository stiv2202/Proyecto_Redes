## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Below is a list of required environment variables in consts.js:

```
REACT_APP_XMPP_SERVER_URL=ws://your-xmpp-server-url:port/ws
REACT_APP_XMPP_DOMAIN=your-xmpp-domain
REACT_APP_XMPP_RESOURCE=your-xmpp-resource
```
Replace your-xmpp-server-url, port, your-xmpp-domain, and your-xmpp-resource with your XMPP server's details.

### XMPP Configuration
Make sure your XMPP server is configured to allow connections from your application. The server should be set up to handle the WebSocket connection and provide the necessary endpoints for authentication, messaging, and presence updates.

### Dependencies
The project relies on several Node.js packages and libraries. Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- React: For building the user interface.
- Strophe.js: For XMPP communication.
- React Spinners: For loading indicators.
- React Icons: For UI icons.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests.
- Prop-Types: For prop type checking.
- Sass: For SCSS styles.

Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies listed in '*package.json*'.

### Webpack Configuration
The project uses Webpack for bundling. Configuration files are located in the '*config*' directory. You can modify these files if you need to adjust the build process or include additional plugins.

### SSL/TLS Configuration
For production environments, ensure that SSL/TLS is configured to secure the WebSocket connections. This will involve setting up an SSL certificate and configuring your server to use wss:// instead of ws://.

### Popup Configuration
The application uses popups for user interactions. Customize the PopUp component to adjust the design and behavior of popups as needed. The component is located in the '*src/components/PopUp*' directory.

### Troubleshooting
- Connection Issues: Ensure that the XMPP server URL and credentials are correct. Verify that your server is running and accessible.
- Missing Dependencies: Check that all required Node.js packages are installed. Run npm install to install any missing packages.
- Build Errors: Check the Webpack and Babel configuration files for errors. Make sure all required loaders and plugins are correctly configured.
